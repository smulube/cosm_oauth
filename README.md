# Cosm OAuth Client

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/[smulube]/[cosm_oauth].png)](http://travis-ci.org/[smulube]/[cosm_oauth])

Simple little library for accessing the [Cosm](https://cosm.com) api via OAuth.

Currently handles obtaining an access_token using OAuth 2 server flow.

Also exposes a very minimal little HTTP api for speaking to Cosm. Just returns
strings containing responses, which can the be parsed accordingly.
